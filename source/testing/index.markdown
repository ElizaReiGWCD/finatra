Testing is a core motivation to the Finatra framework and Finatra provides a powerful testing framework allowing for very robust tests of different types.

## Basics

Finatra provides the following testing features:

- the ability to start a locally running service and easily issue requests against it and assertion behavior on the responses.
- the ability to easily replace or override class implementations throughout the object graph.
- the ability to retrieve classes in the object graph to perform assertions on them.
- the ability to write tests and deploy test instances without deploying test code to production.
